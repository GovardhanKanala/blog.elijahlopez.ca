This document are my notes and midterm review for the BU 375 Operations course taught at Wilfrid Laurier University. While studying for the midterm, I discovered my own formulae shortcuts, undoubtly due to "blind teaching syndrome" (I made that term up).
So let's begin. I'll add a divider to let you know what is part of the midterm.

## Appendix

It's better to have the appendix at the top rather than the bottom, as people know where to find the nitty gritties.

### Control Factors

Out with the ugly table, and in with the new!
It's absurd that at $500+ per course and hundreds of students, universities do not collaborate with eachother to make course curriculum/content, do not strive for perfect function (notes) and rarely place importance on aesthetics.

## Operations Management Introduction

### Transformation Process

- General idea: inputs -> transformation process -> output
- Feedback between inputs <-> process <-> output
- Value is created
- Physical, locational, exchange, physiological, psychological, informational
- Value = Price consumers are willing to pay - Cost to produce

#### Input

- Materials, machines, labor, management, and capital
- These inputs are determined by the **requirements** for the output

#### Output

- Goods and services

### Cost of Quality

Total = cost of achieving good quality + cost of poor quality

#### Good

- Prevetion
- Appraisal/Measuring

#### Poor

- Internal failure
- External failure

#### Quality Index (QI)

Measures quality cost against a base value (e.g. manufacturing, sales, labor hours, quantity)

<img class=equation-tall src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?QI=\frac{Total\,\,Cost\,\,of\,\,Quality}{Base}\times 100">

## Productivity

### Single-Factor Productivity

<img class=equation-tall src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\frac{Output}{Specific\,\,Input}">

where Specific Input could be Labor, Materials, Capital.

### Total Factor Productivity

<img class=equation-tall src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\frac{Output}{All\,\,Inputs}">

To calculate multifactor productivity, use a subset of inputs.

### Yield

<img class=equation src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?Yield=(Initial\,\,Quantity)\times(%good)+(1-%good)(%reworked)">

OR

<img class=equation src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?Yield=(Initial\,\,Quantity)(%{good}_1)...(%{good}_n)">

### Product Cost

For this one, I have my own simplified formulas.

<img class=equation-tall src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?Product\,\,Cost=\frac{(mfg\,\,cost)+(rework\,\,cost)(1-%good)(%reworked)}{%good\times(1-%good)(%reworked)}">

This avoids calculating how many units were reworked.

### Quality Productivity Ratio (QPR)

Even for this one, I have my own method, but I'll include the original in case some information isn't given.

<img class=equation-tall src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?QPR=\frac{% good}{(input)(processing\,\,cost)+(1-%good)(%reworked)(rework\,\,cost)}">

<img class=equation-tall src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?QPR=\frac{good}{(input)(processing\,\,cost)+(reworked)(rework\,\,cost)}">

## Statistical Analysis

- A type I Alpha error is an error that wasn't supposed to fall outside the control limits. False-positive.
- A type II Beta error is an error that should've falled outside the control limits.
- Variations are either random or assignable.
- `n` refers to sample size or number of observations, and `k` refers to the number of samples.
- `z` refers to the sigma count; either 2 or 3
- UCL and LCL stand for upper control limit and lower control limit.

### p-chart

A p-chart is a control limit chart with relation to the proportion of defects. It is used when there are multiple observations per sample and defects are reported.

<img class=equation-tall src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\bar p=\frac{total\,\,defects}{nk}">
<img class=equation-tall src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\sigma_p=\sqrt{\frac{\bar p(1-\bar p)}{n}}">
<img class=equation src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?UCL=\bar p+z\sigma_p, LCL=\bar p-z\sigma_p">

### c-chart

Similar to p-chart, except there is only 1 observation per sample.

<img class=equation-tall src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\bar c=\frac{total\,\,defects}{k}">

<img class=equation src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\sigma_c=\sqrt{\bar c}">

<img class=equation src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?UCL=\bar c+2\sigma_c, LCL=\bar c-2\sigma_c">

### x-chart

A chart used for checking if process variability is in control.

<img class=equation src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\bar{\bar x}=grand\,\,mean = mean\,\,of\,\,means">

<img class=equation-tall src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\sigma_x=\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt n}">

<img class=equation src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?UCL=\bar{\bar x}+z\sigma_x, LCL=\bar{\bar x}-z\sigma_x">

<!-- Ctrl + F sigma -->

In the case σ is unknown, use the control factors table along with thse formulas:

<img class=equation src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?UCL=\bar{\bar x}+A_2\bar R, LCL=\bar{\bar x}-A_2\bar R">

### R-chart

A range chart, to test if variability is in control. Use the control factors table to determine factor values or to help you figure out other factor values.

<img class=equation src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\bar R=average\,\,range">

<img class=equation src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?UCL=D_4{\bar R}, LCL=D_3\bar R">

### Reliability

To improve reliability,

- reduce number of components in a series
- increase backup components
- increase individual component reliability

To calculate the relaibility of a process, use these two functions.

#### Series

For components in a series (independents), multiply their reliability scores:

<img class=equation src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?x_1x_2x_3">

#### Parallel (Backups)

For components that are in parallel (i.e. backups exist), follow this schema,

<img class=equation src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?x_1+(1-x_1)x_2+(1-x_1)(1-x_2)x_3">

#### System Availability

<img class=equation-tall src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?SA=\frac{mean\,\,time\,\,between\,\,failures}{MTBF+mean\,\,repair\,\,time}">

### Process Capability Index

When design mean and process mean are the same use c<sub>p</sub>, otherwise c<sub>pk</sub>.

If c<sub>p</sub> and c<sub>pk</sub> are >= 1, then the process is capable (99.70%).
If c<sub>p</sub> = c<sub>pk</sub>, then design mean and process mean are the same.

<img class=equation-tall src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?c_p=\frac{upper\,\,limit-lower\,\,limit}{6\sigma}">

I tweaked the formula for c<sub>pk</sub>. Instead of dividing both numbers by 3σ, divide only the min.

<img class=equation-tall src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?c_{pk}=\frac{\min\{{upper\,\,limit-process\,\,mean,process\,\,mean-lower\,\,limit}\}}{3\sigma}">

The number chosen also represents which limit the process (mean) deviated towards.

## Server Model

- Poisson distribution
- First in First Out (FIFO)
- Infinite population because people served can re-join the queue

The lambda variable refers to mean arrival rate and the mu variable refers to mean service rate.

## Supply Chain Management Strategy & Design

- Chain of organizations and facilities, with varying activities
- Multi-tiered
- Activities
  - forecasting, purchasing, product/proces design, manufacturing, quality assurance, inventory management, distribution

### Supply Chain Process

1. Procurement of raw materials and services
2. Production of product and services
3. Storage of products in inventory
4. Taking orders and distribution of products to the customer

### Supply Chain for Service Providers

- Focuses on human resources
- Fewer tiers

### Supply Chain Management (SCM)

- Systemic approach to manage entire flow of information, materials, and services from raw-materials to customers
- Goal: perfecting coordination and collabortaion of components to effectively meet demand at the right price, time, and place
- Competition becomes between supply chains rather than companies
- Transparency is important

#### Bullwhip Effect

- Supply chain members farther down the line get information after the members
nearer to customers.
- Safety stock issues
- Lack of accurate demand information
- Order batching results in less orders but larger quantities
- Price fluctuations
- Shortage gaming (placing orders more than is required bc inventory is short supply)
- Solutions
  - Coordination by parties for pricing, transportation, and inventory management
  - Joint demand information forecast
  - Price stabilization
  - Discouraging shortage gaming

I believe a solution is for the supplier to force the orderer to
tell them when the next order will be. That way, a supplier won't have to decide
whether to anticipate more orders if batch ordering occurs.

### Supply Chain Uncertainty

- Inaccurate demand forecasting
- Long and Varying times for orders
- Late/Incomplete shipments
- Product changes and price fluctuations/discounts
- Batch ordering and inflated orders
- Failures cause chain reactions, leading to lag, lack of supply, and lower sales
- Inventory is used as insurance against uncertainty, however optimality needs to be determined

### Supply Chain Coordination and Integration

- Sharing information
- Coordinated workflow, production, and operations, procurement
- Adopt new business models and tech
- Collaborative Planning, Forecasting, Replenishment (CPFR)
- Entreprise Resource Planning (ERP)

### Information Technology

- E-Business
- Electronic data interchange (EDI)
- Barcode and point-of-sale (POS) data
- Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)
- Internet
- Blockchain

### Supply Chain Performance

- inventory turnover
- weeks of supply

<img class=equation-tall src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?Inventory\,\,Turnover=\frac{cost\,\,of\,\,goods\,\,sold}{average\,\,aggregate\,\,value\,\,of\,\,inventory}">

Average aggregate inventory value is the sum of average inventory times value for each item.

<img class=equation-tall src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?Days\,\,of\,\,Supply=\frac{365}{Inventory\,\,Turnover}">

Fill Rate = fraction of orders filled within a specific time period.

### Work Breakdown Structure

### CPM / PERT

- Critcal Path Method (CPM) & Program Evaluation Review Technique

## Demand Forecasting

Projections of demand for products/services underlies strategic planning when it comes to plant or service
design.

- often inaccurate
- forecasts of similar goods is more accurate than individual items
- forecast horizons increases uncertainty

### Decision Based on Forecasts

- Production and Operations
  - aggregate planning
  - inventory control
  - scheduling
- Finance
  - plant/equipment investment
  - budgetery planning
- Marketing
  - new product introduction
  - sales-force allocation
  - promotions
- Human Resources
  - workforce planning
  - hiring, layoff

### Making Forecasts Useful

- long enough to make it relevant
  - typically for daily, weekly, or monthly sales demand for up to approximately two
  years into the future, depending on the company and the type of industry.
- limitations on accuracy must be clearly stated
- forecasting method should be reliable
- operations forecasts should be expressed in units

### Time-Series Methods

#### naive method

#### moving average

#### weighted moving average

#### exponential smoothing

<img class=equation src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?F_{t+1}=\alpha D_t + (1-\alpha)F_t">

#### adjusted exponential smoothing

Example

For the data given below, generate a forecast period 1 - 5 sing adjusted exponential smoothing.
Assume alpha = 0.5 and beta = 0.3.

The formula for the adjusted exponential smoothing forecast requires an initial value for Tt to start
the computational process. For this case let's assume initial T is 0.

Ft = Ft-1 + alpha(A_t-1 - F_t-1)

Tt = Beta(Ft - F_t-1) + (1 - Beta)T_t-1

| Period | Month  | Demand | Forecast Ft | Trend Ti |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ----------- | ----------- |
| 1      | JAN    | 37     | 37.00      | -
| 2      | FEB    | 40     | 37.00     | 0
| 3      | MAR    | 41     | 38.50      | 0.45
| 4      | APR    | 37     | 39.75      | 0.69
| 5      | MAY    | 45     | 38.37     | 0.07
