This document are my notes and midterm review for the BU 375 Operations course taught at Wilfrid Laurier University. While studying for the midterm, I discovered my own formulae shortcuts, undoubtly due to "blind teaching syndrome" (I made that term up). So let's begin. I'll add a divider to let you know what's part of the midterm review.

I'm probably going to write this while recording a youtube video, so let's try that.

## Appendix

It's better to have the appendix at the top rather than the bottom, as people know where to find the nitty gritties.

### Control Factors

Out with the ugly table, and in with the new!
It's absurd that at $500+ per course and hundreds of students, universities do not collaborate with eachother to make course curriculum/content, do not strive for perfect function (notes) and rarely place importance on aesthetics.

## Operations Management Introduction

### Transformation Process

- General idea: inputs -> transformation process -> output
- Feedback between inputs <-> process <-> output
- Value is created
- Physical, locational, exchange, physiological, psychological, informational
- Value = Price consumers are willing to pay - Cost to produce

#### Input

- Materials, machines, labor, management, and capital
- These inputs are determined by the **requirements** for the output

#### Output

- Goods and services

### Major Components of a Firm

#### Primary Areas

- Operatios
- Marketing
  - research, packaging
- Finance and Accounting
- Human Resources (HR)
- Outside Suppliers

### Importance

- Middle of the firm
- Opportunity to innovate (internally)
- Results in failure

### Decisions

- Design
  - long-term
  - Equipment, capacity, layout, location
- Day-to-Day Operations
  - Scheduling, quality control, labor requirements, input procurement

## Strategic Planning

### Globalization

- Thinking big
- Foreign markets, production, purchasing, partnerships
- Iterests: cost, international, reliability

### Missing Statement

- What does the firm do and sell?

#### Vision

Direction of the firm in 10 years

#### Values

- Common beliefs

### Consumer Exepectations

### Order Qualifiers & Winners

Price, [Quality](#quality), Variety (comparing to competitors), [Timeliness](#server-model), Convenience, Customer Service

#### Order Qualifiers

Basic criteria for product candidacy (functional)

#### Order Winners

Differentiating criteria (aesthetic)

### Strategy

- direction for acheiving a ission
- consistency
- dependent on organization size
  - formal (larger)
- mission statement

#### Formulation

- Primary task
- Core competenciese (competitive advantage)
- Order qualifiers & winneres
- Positioning (how to compete)
- Deployment

### Positioning / Competitivness

- common goals
- collabortation
- expertise
- learning from past experiences
- cost
  - waste elimination
  - trades off with quality sometimes
- quality (reducing defects)
- flexibility
  - ability to change internal processes to accomodate needs
  - trades off with speed
- speed / delivery
  - based on context

### Key performance Indicators (Evaluation)

1. Finances
2. Customers
3. Processes
4. Learning
5. Tools: balanced scorecard worksheet

## Quality

Fitness for use, design. (PDCA) plan, act check, do.

### Products

performance, features, relaibility, conformance (to the design), durability, serviceablility, aesthetics, safety,
perceptions

### Serivces

Time, completeness, courtesy, consistency, accessibility, accuracy, responsiveness, HARDER TO EVALUATE

### Total Quality Management (TQM)

- Continuous improvement
- Customer satisfaction
- Involves employees and management
- Performance tracking

### W.E. Demmings

- Statistical quality-control techniques
- Continuous improvement
- Inspect at stages before final
- Responsibility lies with management and employees
- Few suppliers & pick **quality > cost**

### Six Sigma

- Decreas process variation

### Tools

- Process Flowchart (location of problem)
- Cause-and-Effect (fishbone) diagram (find root cause)
- Check Sheet (form)
- Pareto Analysis (data collection) and Chart
- Scatter Diagram
- Control Chart

### Cost of Quality

Total = cost of achieving good quality + cost of poor quality

#### Good

- Prevetion
- Appraisal/Measuring

#### Poor

- Internal failure
- External failure

#### Quality Index (QI)

Measures quality cost against a base value (e.g. manufacturing, sales, labor hours, quantity)

<img class=equation src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?QI=\frac{Total\,\,Cost\,\,of\,\,Quality}{Base}\times 100">

## Productivity

### Single-Factor Productivity

<img class=equation src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\frac{Output}{Specific\,\,Input}">

where Specific Input could be Labor, Materials, Capital.

### Total Factor Productivity

<img class=equation src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\frac{Output}{All\,\,Inputs}">

To calculate multifactor productivity, use a subset of inputs.

### Yield

<img class=equation src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?Yield=(Initial\,\,Quantity)\times(%good)+(1-%good)(%reworked)">

OR

<img class=equation src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?Yield=(Initial\,\,Quantity)(%{good}_1)...(%{good}_n)">

### Product Cost

For this one, I have my own simplified formulas.

<img class=equation src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?Product\,\,Cost=\frac{(mfg\,\,cost)+(rework\,\,cost)(1-%good)(%reworked)}{%good\times(1-%good)(%reworked)}">

This avoids calculating how many units were reworked.

### Quality Productivity Ratio (QPR)

Even for this one, I have my own method, but I'll include the original in case some information isn't given.

<img class=equation src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?QPR=\frac{% good}{(input)(processing\,\,cost)+(1-%good)(%reworked)(rework\,\,cost)}">

<img class=equation src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?QPR=\frac{good}{(input)(processing\,\,cost)+(reworked)(rework\,\,cost)}">

## Statistical Analysis

A type I Alpha error is an error that wasn't supposed to fall outside the control limits. False-positive.

A type II Beta error is an error that should've falled outside the control limits.
