What happens when a retail investor creates an order? It goes to the retail brokerage, and then gets sold to a wholesaler (marketmaker).

We can't sell directly to wholesaler or brokerage because there's capital requirements for the exchanges/wholesalers. Registered **broker-dealer status** to connect to an exchange.

- sane, sophisticated, experienced
- brokerages exist to prevent incorrect trades to break the market
- each exchange has their own engines
- as fast as possible to execute trades (e.g. HFT)
- colocation to the exchange (physically located)
  - buying space right beside the exchange servers (no metre of advantage)
  - servers are located in the same servers as the exchanges
  - Most located in New Jersey
  - TSX servers located in Markham
  - Electricity crisis/costs in big cities are higher
- In US, there are 3-4 data centres (NYSE, NASDAQ, NYSEARCA, CBOE which controls DirectEdge, BAT)
- Why does CBOE own DirectEdge and BAT
  - Economies of scale (technology sharing)
  - Fixed costs: very high technology costs, software engineering labour, strategy costs
  - Tends to favour larger companies
- Exchanges do no trade, invest, participate
- All intermediaries benefit from ?
- Intermediation costs $1T per year to run
- FINRA ADF
  - Trades that occur off the exchange (retail and wholesalers)
  - Dark pools
- Wholesalers
  - Citadel
  - Virtu (between C & V, 71% of all retail flow)
  - G1
  - Two Sigma
  - UBS
  - Jane Street
  - Merrill Lynch
  - Morgan Stanley
- In Canada, there are no wholesalers, retail brokers send orders directly to the exchange
  - US system is unique

Bid-Ask Spread

- Ask (higher price)
- Bid (lower price)
  - If there is a bid-ask spread of 0.01, how can a bid at the lower price be filled?
- Aggressive and Passive Orders (vice-versa for buying and selling)
  - Aggressive buy at higher price
    - US retailers are mostly market buy orders
    - Brokerages might try to dark pattern market orders instead of limit orders
      - Why? Payment for order flow incentivizes market orders
      - Why does SEC allow it? wholesalers have handshake agreements to price-improve the current spread. Brokers regularly evaluate.
    - Slippage: different in market price and market fill price
  - Passive, buy at lower price, takes longer, might not execute
- Why are spreads widening since 2010 but we have higher liquidity?
  - The higher the price, the higher the spreads
