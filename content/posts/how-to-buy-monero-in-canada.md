## Fixed Float

Assuming you can purchase XLM via [Newton](https://web.newton.co/r/YREHXA), use [Fixed Float](https://fixedfloat.com/XLM/XMR?ref=dybjhjrb) for 0.5% - 1% fee per trade.

## Kraken

### CAD -> USD -> XMR

A deposit fee of 0.1%, a USD conversion fee of 0.2%, and a 0.16% post limit order fee to buy XMR, and a flat network fee to withdraw.
In total, that's 0.46% as a maker and a 0.56% fee as a taker.

### XLM -> USD -> XMR

Depositing XLM only incurs network fees. Selling to USD has a 0.16% fee for a post limit order, and a post limit order on XMR is another 0.16%.
That's 0.34% as a 2x maker and 0.52% as a 2x taker.

### USD -> XMR

You'll need a USD bank account for this and you'll need Etana which is another KYC hurdle. Theoretically this method results in
a 0.16% fee as a maker and a 0.26% fee as a taker. I say theoretically though since I don't know if there's any fee from Etana's side and
it's not practical as like I said before, you need to have USD beforehand without a conversion fee.

## Local Monero

[Local Monero](https://localmonero.co/?rc=nde2) is more private but costs more, requires greater level of trust, and takes a longer time excluding KYC time.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, it's better to buy XLM on Newton, sell it for USD on Kraken, and then buy XMR with the USD.
