Buying houses (living spaces) for the purpose of financial gain is unethical. Before we delve into my argument, let me give a small example of the toilet paper market to illustrate the problem.

## Something to Remember

Let's go to 2020 when toilet paper ran out. Did the COVID-19 lockdowns cause supply chain disruptions in March 2020? No it did not. So why did toilet paper run out? It's because people were buying more toilet paper than they needed. Unless the price of toilet paper went up, the entire supply would be wiped. And that's exactly what occured. The entire supply of toilet paper got wiped, but what am I getting at? Put simply, the people who bought more toilet paper than they usually did ended up taking away toilet paper from those who actually needed toilet paper. I provide this example to highlight that people can be prevented from acquiring their necessities in life not because of a supply problem, but because others are inconsiderate. In this classic example, selfishness and greed took away instead of producing.

Before you start coming up with a response, I'll admit toilet paper isn't an extreme necessity.
The people who took too much didn't buy in the next restocking.

However, you know what is a more serious necessity? A place to live. So let us begin.

## Main Argument

Some Canadians see the housing market as a vehicle for financial gains. In other words, they are rent-seekers and applied to the housing market, they are behaving unethically.

- buying properties to sell at a higher inflation adjusted and renovation excluded price
- charging rent for positive cash-flow. AKA subsidized mortgage payment

Why is this unethical? People need a place to live. By owning properties that you don't live in for the sole purpose of investment, you are gatekeeping home ownership. Ownership means that you have the right to do what you want to the property: customization, convertion, demolition, kicking someone out. Human rights is about the right to life **and liberty**. By treating housing as an investment, you are making it harder for someone to exercise their liberty (higher house prices).
And by charging a rent amount that subsidizes your mortgage payment, you are now making the people who can't afford properties pay for your equity ownership. If you did not read this sentence to its depths, you are participating in a wealth transfer of the poor to your pockets. Your wealth is generated on the backs of people poorer than you and not by you producing goods & services. By charging those renters a price that subsidizes your mortgage and property tax, you are taking away their assets so that you can have yours! If you still don't get why this is unethical, you are taking advantage of a person of lesser fortune by taking their wealth to increase your own.

It's easy to beahve and speak ethically when your self-interests is aligned with the ethical topic,
however a genuine ethical person is willing to act and speak even against their own self-interests.
I am not claiming to be perfect but rather that I seek to be just more than those who this article is intended for.

From an economical point of ivew, *subsidized mortgage rent does not increase a countries wealth.*

## But the Stock Market is rent-seeking!

Yes stock market is rent-seeking. But that weath comes from the workers of the public company. Companies choose to go public, they
were not forced and it is not necessary for companies to buy back shares, and neither is it necessary for other humans to buy your
shares. In other words, bidding the price of shares up hurts only the ones shorting the stock and yourself if it was dumb decision.

The key difference is that when you take a loan to buy a share, no one is forced to rent that share from you. Stock shorters are
volunteerily choosing to rent your shares when they sell them.

## Aside

To my first-year business professor who insinuated that short-selling should be illegal because it is illegal to sell a borrowed car and returning the same model and make car bought from someone else: shares are **fungible**, cars are not.

Plug: You what else isn't fungible? Bitcoin, Doge, Ethereum, Ripple, Cardano, Tether.
Out of the top 25 cryptocurries, only Monero is fungible.
