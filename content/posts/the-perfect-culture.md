Let's get something straight. At the moment, no culture is perfect. There are always flaws. The objective
of this article is to develop the perfect culture, through the act of opening ourselves to other ideas.

## Cultural Pitfalls

- In English speaking developed countries (e.g. Canada, USA, UK, Australia), toilet paper is used to clean bums after pooping rather than water
- Catholics are prohibited from using contraception, and thus the cycle of poverty continues in Africa (less kids implies less resources to live)
- Muslim women are prohibited from showing their hair in public (regardless of laws, the Quran stipulates this)
- In case someone gets ideas about my beliefs, another example is that Muslim men are to glance downwards instead of making eye contact with women
- Japan's (and India's) over-working culture
  - The goal of humans should be to work to enjoy the fruits of their labor
  - The best way to do this is to automate
  - By prioritizing work, we can never enjoy our scarce lives; everyone dies in the end
- In all countries, the role of the government is vague
  - In US, it's to promote civililty and general welfare however San Fransico is a perfect dichotomy
  - In Canada, we have a constitutional monarchy; paying $50M+ for dormant dictatorship under the guise of democracy
- I can't comment on the cuture of European countries mainily because I don't remember much and the issues aren't cultural
  - One can argue that the culture is the cause for the lack of economic freedoms
  - For example, I think Canada and the US are better for working, while European countries are better for resting
