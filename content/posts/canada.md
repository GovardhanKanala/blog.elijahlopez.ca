## The Ideal Canadian Life

What is the ideal Canadian life? I want to answer this question.
The age at which this idealism should be achieved for Canadians is 30 years old.
I believe by 30 people would start a family. I also know that by 30,
we start to visually age. So at 30, we want to be living the most ideal life.

### Living Situation

I haven't made up my mind on whether to have children or not, but in the off chance that I
do, I'd probably have 2 children. Therefore, an ideal _house_ will have 3-4 bedrooms.
The extra one is for guests. I think there should also be 3 washrooms.

One should plan out the general location where they want to build a family right after marriage[^marriage] because then you won't be locked into a location because of work, family, or friends. I'm pretty sure this is one of the biggest factors preventing people from moving to affordable locations. The other factors are activities which we'll get to now. Personally, I would love to live in New Brunswick, but I'll try to cater to all. If you want nightlife, you'll have to lower your bedroom and washroom numbers.

[^marriage]: by marriage I mean the unification of partners in a relationship rather than the legal sense

### Activities

For this, I'll have to think from other peoples' shoes. We have two ways to go for this. We can go suburban or urban.
For sake of the American Dream _fantasy_, we'll go the suburban route. So our activities consist of: waterpark within two hours, theme park within 2 hours, a picnic type park within 15 minutes, biking routes, tennis court, basketball court, soccer fields. Also a gym if you want to improve your physique. You can reduce or increase this list based on your wants.

### Income

Oooo, the big one. I'll keep it brief. Typically, we want $1M in cash by the time of retirement. Why? With $1M and 7% average annual S&P 500 return, we get $50,000-$70,000 per year if income tax is payable or not. I believe this is enough since we shouldn't be paying a mortgage in retirement and we wouldn't be going on a wild spending spree. With disposable income of $4,000 / month which would be worth $2,000 minimum accounting for inflation, we're good.
In total, household networth at retirement (age 55) should be $1.5M to $3M. Usually in Business classes, we'd do some math to calculate money needed at retirement in order to die with X amount of money, but since we are dealing with ideal lifestyles, we want to be able to live off passive income and leave our children with something.

We need to employ some financial equations now to account for real stock market growth of 8.66%.[^Moneychimp] To get this number, we use 35 years of data from Jan 1st 1986 to Dec 31 2021, adjust for inflation, add dividends, and subtract 0.03% because VOO is the cheapest S&P 500 exchange traded fund (ETF).

I don't have time to update my old investing article, but I summarized the basics [here](/posts/investing).

We need to calculate income per month given a yield, a future value. and a time period. The formula for that is as follows:

## Preface

It is March 15th 2022.
I'm 20 years old and as a software (devops) engineer intern, I'm getting paid more than 50% of Canadians aged 25-34 years old.
The median income for 25-34 year olds in Canada was C$41,700 for both sexes and $45,600 for males in 2019.[^fn1]
$45,600 translates roughly to C$23/hr assuming 40 hours per week for 49 weeks.

I bring this up because we need to take into account what it means.
Ideally, we'd all want to focus on non-materialistic goals AFTER we've met our materialistic goals.
If Canadians all had non-materialistic goals, they wouldn't be complaining about housing ownership affordability.
So let's skip the notion that it is only a small group of people that are materialistic. The opposite is true;
most people are materialistic, only some are willing to accept this, others do not, and yes only a minority take
it too far.

Putting a down payment for a home at 30 or something is possible, but it would still take 30 years
to pay off the home. This is without factoring in possible kids. To have a kid without financial hardships,
would require both parents to work, which is the norm in 2022, but go back 50 years and only one parent had to work.
Ideally, one working parent without benefits, should be enough to support a kid, but this simply is not possible for a big chunk of Canadians today.

## The Economic Point

Why am I saying all this? Well because I want what's best for Canada and what goes on today
is not at all the best.

### Why does the Government Spend Money?

> To improve the lives of its citizens and residents

1. It falsely assumes that it can make the optimal choice
    - Housing prices increase more percentage wise year over year than median wages
    - The optimal choice of the government would prevent housing bubble to keep growing and would in fact correct it
2. It falsely assumes that the optimal choice is to spend more
    - Spending money on a new bullshit job is not optimal
        - A small point, but the governor general is redundant, all for show, is an artifact of monarachy
    - Spending money on pipeline is not optimal if the goal was anti-oil
        - If the government's stance is anti-oil, a pipeline isn't going to make things smoother,
            it just adds confusion and won't benefit oil companies that have been restricted in the first place
    - Spending money on a non-profit to handle $900M student grant program[^fn2]
        - A non-profit is similar to a profit but its tax exempt, has no shareholders, and so does not pay out dividends
        - A non-profit can pay employees, so the members effectively become informal shareholders
        - There's nothing stopping non-profits from using extra cash as income bonuses
3. It falsely assumes that it makes the optimal spending decisions
    - There is no guarantee the government is open-minded and takes into account all stakeholders' thoughts
    - Bill C10 treats internet as a broadcom[^fn3]
        - Spending here is the indirect spending on MPs to draft, debate, vote on this bill, as well as the yearly regulatory maintainence if the bill suceeds
        - Fiber cables are privately owned, unlike radio waves which are publiclly owned
        - Any assertion, however little, that the internet is broadcom, is a gross violation of private property rights
        - The bill assumes that
            - a) internet companies take away revenue from the news articles that are linked on the site \
                - foolish, if these internet companies decided to ban these news sites from being linked, the news sites
                  lose money
            - b) news companies have a right to the ads displayed along side their linked article
                - the internet company does the work to show the news sites to its users?
                - the news sites are only one part of the content?
                - why should news sites be given special priviledges over individual users that post content?
            - i) Little to no implications
                - Google is worth over $1T, many times over CBC. Google doesn't need CBC, CBC needs Google.
                - These companies only opereate in Canada, they can leave and hurt Canadians if they want to
                - Following from above, this law would hurt Canandian internet companies and drive innovation out of Canada
                    - Brain drain already exists, it would be worse if American companies didn't operate physically in Canada at all
    - Foreign aid does not economically benefit Canadians
        - Unless Canada is secretly anti-immigration
            - Except that too requires smartly injecting money into foreign countries
            - If you don't understand what I mean, imagine a world where the quality of life in India is as good as the quality of life in Canada
                - What reason would the present Indian expats have to leave India for Canada?
        - Ukraine
            - What's going on in Ukraine is wrong,
            - Putin isn't entirely to blame for the context, but is for the Northern and Southern invasion
            - Underlying goals of Russia are unknown
            - Funding any side of the war does not directly benefit Canadians
                - Ukrainian-Canadians are not going to be happy as long as Russia is still invading Ukraine

With these points out the way, Canada has a huge problem. We have ~5% unemployment, which is not low at all.
1 in 20 people are unemploymed, not including people who are jobless and not looking for work. That's insane.

On top of the above, inflation is >2%. Let's hope the people who are unemployed are rich, because the value of
their savings are being depleted, unless its mostly in stocks or real estate. The real estate market is and has been
in a bubble. The percentage price increase is more than the percentage price increase of median wages. With wage suppression and brain drain,
Canada's future is extreme housing inequality. Canada mightly only be better than USA on the genie index because we don't have as many rich people.
If we take out the outliers, we're left with people who's parents or themselves own a home vs. people and their parents who don't own a home.
This is happening in one of the biggest countries in the world by land mass, and with one of the lowest population densities.

This housing issue is more than costs. It's about population concentration. What drives concentration? Opportunities; be it social or economical.
The easiest solution is to divert attention to smaller cities and smaller provinces. For Ontario, places like Windsor and cities north of Barrie are expensive, but not as expensive as the GTA.

[Family homes in Huntsville, ON](https://www.realtor.ca/map#view=list&Sort=1-A&GeoIds=g30_f0p9sp90&GeoName=Huntsville%2C%20ON&PropertyTypeGroupID=1&PropertySearchTypeId=1&TransactionTypeId=2&BedRange=3-0&BathRange=2-0&Currency=CAD)

I filtered 3+ bedrooms and 3+ bathrooms because it's entirely possible to want more kids to "make up" for people who have less than 2 kids. There are only a few homes,
however my point is that housing projects combined with new opportunities would let more afford these areas. I'm not talking about Huntsville in general, but
the entire Northern half of Ontario itself. It would take a huge commitment, but if its done over a decade or two, and across many provinces, the pain would alleviate.

Before doing that though, Windsor should be home to the experiment. Those northerna areas are more snowy, so the first goal should be convincing people to move to Windsor.
Some possibilites are collaborating with Detroit, creating tourist attractions downtown, improving the urban life there, and msot importantly, improving the
job opportunities.

### You Said Attitude

Yes I did. This comes from Canada's lack of apparent attitude to improving Canada not only on a national scale, but internationally as well.
Canada should be striving to become the best country in all areas, not just the core: better social education system, free healthcare with caveats, good environment.

Canada is miles behind in the tech (software and hardware), defence, and aerospace industries. We don't have our own Lockheed martin company,
we don't have space companies, we don't have mega tech companies. And of course we have these types of companies, but they aren't even a tenth of the size
of the American counterparts, and they are definitely not as competitive.

Our stock exchange gives worse returns than the housing bubble and the S&P 500!
Our biggest companies are banks, insurance, investing. Innovation is no where in sight! Canadian National Railway? Our GO Trains go 100kmh.
Shopify? A good start, but not even a tenth of Facebook; yes it's a tenth in terms of market cap, but in revenue and profit, it's 1/33.
Where are the hardware companies? Who is producing electronics for us? Canada is resource rich. What's holding us back is the inability to reward and
incentivize our talent pool, and that failure is 100% the fault of the pronvicial and federal governments.

I bring the pronvincial government into the picture, because although people think Canada's education system is good, it could be a lot better.
For example, Math is super slow. Grade 9 math. In grade 3, I was the only one who could answer what 7 x 7 was. Canadians shouldn't just be smart
enough to talk smuggly, but also to defend their smugness. I do give partial credit to my dad for teaching me the basics, but I won't share them.
The last time I shared them with people, it either went over their heads or they were unappreciative of it. Not makig that mistake again.

Anyways, math is just one field. The other field I weigh importance to is physical fitness. Physical fitness should be mandatory for every grade, even 12th,
and it should be daily. Schools can't enforce kids to exercise at home and so should motivate students to it in class starting at an early age.
Exercising isn't about marks, so there should be no marks associated with the activity. There is this focus on marks, but the truth is, marks don't matter until
after 10th grade. The only thing that matters before highschool, is the aptitude to learn, which will be further improved when kids don't have to worry about
their physical and mental health, their social lives, their neighborhood. School can help with physical and mental health. For some reason, society does
not care about physical health and when it comes to mental health the emphasis is on curing, not preventing.

### Mental Health

I will mention that my mental health problems could not be prevented externally, and was more of a perception kind of problem.
My advice is to confront the root of the problem, to not let things slide, and to not back down. Voicing your thoughts is almost always a good idea.
The worst is when the person you are voicing them to is arrogant and not intelligent. Then the best course of action is to not speak 3 times,
but rather act while reducing the possibility of retaliation or with protection from retaliation. Do not leave any inch of yourself vulnerable and most importantly,
find more like minded people. It's hard to do, but groups of people are naturally more intimidating than a single person.
