This post tests if Hugo with the anubis theme works.
I'm thinking of self publishing articles rather than posting on Medium.
Medium's UI is slower than YouTube's and its a website that's text based!

The following command is how to make a new post with `hugo`.

```bash
hugo new content/posts/filename.md
```
