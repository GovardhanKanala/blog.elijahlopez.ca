I don't even have HDR capabilities, so these were the optimal color settings when recording.

1. Go to Settings
2. Go to Advanced
3. Change Color Format to **I444**
4. Change Color Space to **sRGB**
5. Change Color Range to **Full**

After a recording test and a computer restart, you can try NV12 again as below.

Color Format: **NV12**
Color Range: **Partial**
Color Space: **sRGB**
