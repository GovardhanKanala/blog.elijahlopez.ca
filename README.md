# ELL Blog

A site I'll be writing new posts on, since Medium is centralized, slow, and doesn't allow you to export/download posts.
When editing, use `http://localhost:1313/` not `127.0.0.1` to view your local blog.
This blog uses the [Anubis Theme](https://github.com/Mitrichius/hugo-theme-anubis).

## Install Hooks

`git config core.hookspath .githooks`
