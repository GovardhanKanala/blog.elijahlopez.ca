- At least 16GB of RAM, although 32GB is ideal
  - OEMs have not started mass producing laptops with 32GB and a GPU but when they do start, it will be the golden age of technology for everyone and not just billion and trillion dollar tech companies
- Intel i5/i7/i9 or AMD Ryzen 5/7/9 for CPU power
- Good battery life while developing
- At least 512GB of storage.
  - I daily drive a Windows laptop that is using 600GB / 1000GB
  - I also own a MacBook Air M2 and 303GB of 1TB are used and on top of developing, it is capable of being used to take notes for school (OneDrive, MEGA, blog).
- Bonus: at least 8GB of VRAM (for AI as well as running 7GB offline LLMs)
- 1080p Camera

So with that said, if you plan distributing anything on the App store, get a 512GB+ macbook. Otherwise, I recommend getting a Windows gaming laptop with the following specs:

- RTX 4070+ level performance
- AMD CPU (better battery life than Intel)
- 24GB+ RAM (16GB+ if you don't plan to develop mobile apps)

If I had to buy a laptop today, I would search [laptop rtx 4070 on BestBuy](https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/search?search=laptop+rtx+4070&sort=priceLowToHigh) and pick an open box or refurbished (with free warranty). Just make sure that the webcam is 1080p.

  - 32GB RAM
- CA$1,999.99 [Legion Pro 5 Gen 8 AMD (16") with RTX™ 4070](https://www.lenovo.com/ca/en/p/laptops/legion-laptops/legion-pro-series/legion-pro-5-gen-8-(16-inch-amd)/82wm0005us#compatible_acc)
  - 16GB RAM
- CA$1,949 (before student discounts) [MacBook Air M3](https://www.apple.com/ca/shop/buy-mac/macbook-air/13-inch-midnight-apple-m3-chip-with-8-core-cpu-and-10-core-gpu-16gb-memory-512gb)

I have the Razer Blade 14 (2022) with RTX 3080-Ti, which was upgraded for free from my 3070-Ti model that broke on me.

- AMD Ryzen 9 6900HX
- 3080-Ti
- 1080p Camera
- 165Hz display
- QHD display

I must confess I only purchased the laptop because it was the only gaming laptop at the time with 1080p camera. Razer has had a worthy premium for many years but it no longer has that advantage.
